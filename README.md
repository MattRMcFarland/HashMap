# Matt McFarland HashMap README

This project was created for KPCB's Engineering Fellows application (2015). It includes two source files that implement the functionality of the fixed size hashmap and a test file to test the implementation of the hashmap.

## Project Description:

This hashmap is a fixed size hashmap implemented in C. A fixed size hashmap means that there is a limited number of entries that can be stored in the map. All of the elements are stored within the hashmap itself (as opposed to a hashmap where each collided entry is chained off of the first element in a given slot)


- describe HASH used, 
- detail why I need stdlib.h, string.h

## Function Descriptions

### CreateMap
#### HashMap * CreateMap(int size)

CreateMap returns a preallocated HashMap that
can contain up to size entries. 

ARGUMENTS:
	size - must be an integer >= 1

RETURN VALUE:
	Returns pointer to new HashMap if successful
	Returns NULL on failure

USAGE:
	HashMap * new_map = CreateMap(size)
 

### Set
#### int Set(HashMap * map, char * key, void * val)

 Set will add a key-value pair to the HashMap
 if it does not exist. If the key already exists
 in the HashMap, then the existing data value will
 be overwritten.

 Note - NULL keys cannot be set in HashMap. Null
 strings can be a valid key however. (ie. key == NULL
 will return FAILURE, but key == "" will try to insert
 or update the data element.) NULL data values are
 valid data elements to store for a key.

 ARGUMENTS:
	map - pointer to valid HashMap to add key-value to
	key - string key to add or update value for (cannot be NULL)
	val - data reference to store with key
 
 RETURN VALUE:
	Returns SUCCESS if key was added/updated 
	Returns FAILURE if error occurs
