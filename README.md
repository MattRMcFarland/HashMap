# Matt McFarland HashMap README

This project was created for KPCB's Engineering Fellows application (2015). It includes two source files that implement the functionality of the fixed size hashmap and a test file to test the implementation of the hashmap.

# Project Description:

This hashmap is a fixed size hashmap implemented in C. A fixed size hashmap means that there is a limited number of entries that can be stored in the map. All of the elements are stored within the hashmap itself (as opposed to a hashmap where each collided entry is chained off of the first element in a given slot)
