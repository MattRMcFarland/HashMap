# Matt McFarland HashMap README

This project was created for KPCB's Engineering Fellows application (2015). It includes two source files that implement the functionality of the fixed size hashmap and a test file to test the implementation of the hashmap.

To run the test executable, run the "TestHashMap" executable.

This project lives at: https://github.com/MattRMcFarland/HashMap.git

## Project Description:

This project implemented a fixed size HashMap in C. A fixed size HashMap can only have a specific number of entries that can be stored in the map (limit declared when the HashMap is created). All of the elements are stored within the HashMap itself (as opposed to a HashMap where each collided entry is chained off of the head element in a given slot in newly allocated memory). So if the HashMap is full and a new element is added, a FAILURE occurs and the new element isn't added. Keys are only placed in the hashmap once, so if the Set function is invoked for a key that already exists in the HashMap, then that key's value will be updated with the new value as opposed to adding a new key-value pair. This implementation of HashMap cannot accept NULL keys, but the data values stored can be NULL.

In order to manage the complexity of tracking collisions (when two discrete keys map to the same slot in the HashMap) that can occur within a fixed size HashMap, this HashMap uses a doubly-linked list of HashNodes. The head of the list resides at the slot all of the nodes collide at. The elements of the list are arbitrarily distributed amonst the free slots in the HashMap. If a new key is added that maps to a slot occupied by a collided entry, the collided entry is moved to a different free slot and the new element is placed in its intended slot.

For example, if keys A, B, and C all hash to slot 13 (and are added in that order), then A will be placed in slot 13 because slot 13 is unoccupied. When B is added, B will collide with A in slot 13. So a free slot is found and then B is placed in that free slot. Then A's next element is pointed at B and B's previous element is pointed at A. When C is added and collides with A in slot 13, C will traverse down A's next list of collided nodes until the end of the list is found. A free slot for C is found and C is inserted there. C is then linked to the end of A's collided list. In this example, that means B's next element will point at C's slot and C's previous element will point at B's slot. 

Continuing this example with A, B, and C, if a fourth element, D is added that hashes to the slot that B occupies, D will see that B is occupying D's intended slot. Since B was placed there arbitrarily, and D belongs is B's slot, B is moved to a different, arbitrary free slot and D is placed in B's old location. B's adjacent linked-list neighbors (A and C) are updated to relect B's new location. If element E is added that also maps to D's slot, then E will be placed in an arbitrary, free slot and attached to D's collision list.

If element A is removed, then A is removed from slot 13. However, because A is the head of a collision list for slot 13 (linking B and C to 13) and that collision list isn't empty, a new head element needs to be placed in slot 13 to maintain the integrity of that collision list. So B, the next element in that collision list, is moved from it's arbitrary location and placed in slot 13. B updates its neighbor C with its new location information.

### Pseudocode

To set a key (and map isn't full), look at its intended slot. If that slot is unoccupied, add the new entry there. If that slot is occupied by another entry that maps to the new entry's slot, traverse that pre-existing entry's collided entry list. While traversing, examine each collided node and see if the new entry is already in HashMap. If it is, just update the data value. If the new entry isn't on the collided list, add the new entry to the end of that list (place the new_entry in an arbitrary, free slot and put it on the end of the linked list).

To get a data value for a key, examine the slot the key maps to and each entry on that slot's collision list for matching keys. If a match isn't found, return failure.

To delete an entry, find the slot the specified key should map to. If occupied, traverse the collision list, examining each entry along the way for a match. Once a match is found, remove that entry from the HashMap (fix up linked list pointers). If the entry is the head of a collision list (exists in the slot that key hashes to), then move the first element in the collision list to the deleted entry's location.

Other Information:

Hash Function: I used the djb2 hash for my hash function. This acts on a string of arbitrary length to return a hash value. More information is included here: http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html

Since I implemented this project in C, I needed to include the following libraries:
- stdlib.h for its memory allocation functions
- string.h for its string operation functions (since a string class would be built into other languages)
- stdio.h for its I/O operations (for verbose debugging and printing map)

## Project Contents

/src/hashmap.h       - public functions and definitions for interacting with HashMap

/src/hashmap.c       - implementation of functions in hashmap.h as well as private functions

/test/TestHashMap.c  - test routine for the functionality of the HashMap

TestHashMap 		 - test executable

Makefile             - builds TestHashMap and runs it

README.md            - this description file

## Building Instructions

Run "make" - This will build TestHashMap executable and run it. If build and tests are completed successfully, user will be notified. Run "make clean" to clean up executables and auxillary files.

The executable TestHashMap can be run in two ways:
- "./TestHashMap" = Quiet mode. Only test result is reported.
- "./TestHashMap verbose" = Verbose mode. Detailed testing is reported to stdout.

## Testing

The following tests are conducted in the TestHashMap executable.
- Try creating a HashMap with negative, zero and positive integer sizes
- Try adding key-value pairs where the map is null, key is null, and the data elements are null
- Test Getting and Deleting keys that have null data
- Test Getting and Deleting keys that don't exist in HashMap
- Add permissible keys and data until HashMap is full (tests collision handling)
- Try adding a key-value to full HashMap
- Remove all of the keys just added
- GetLoad when HashMap is full and empty
- DeleteMap is tested

SPECIAL CASE - SIZE = 10 -> When the SIZE constant is defined as 10, the collision handling mechanism used in this HashMap become clear. Run "TestHashMap verbose" to see representations of the map printed out throughout the collisions handling. A collided element "0" gets moved to a different slot by a new addition "1" on a different slot. When the original element that the second element collided with is removed (""), the second element "0" is moved back to the head of the collision list (back to first element's slot).

All of these tests have been conducted in a memory management environment. All memory leaks have been handled and plugged.

To see more verbose testing output, use "TestHashMap verbose" and uncomment the "#define DEBUG" statement at the top of the hashmap.c file.

## Function Descriptions

### CreateMap
#### HashMap * CreateMap(int size)

CreateMap returns a preallocated HashMap that can contain up to size entries.

ARGUMENTS:

- size: must be an integer greater than zero

RETURN VALUE:

- Returns pointer to new HashMap if successful
- Returns NULL if map could not be created
 

### Set
#### int Set(HashMap * map, char * key, void * val)

Set will add a key-value pair to the HashMap if it does not exist. If the key already exists in the HashMap, then the existing data value will be overwritten.

Note - NULL keys cannot be set in HashMap. Null strings can be a valid key however. (ie. key NULL will return FAILURE, but key "" will try to insert or update the data element.) NULL data values are valid data elements to store for a key.

ARGUMENTS:

- map: pointer to valid HashMap to add key-value to
- key: string key to add or update value for (cannot be NULL)
- val: data reference to store with key
 
RETURN VALUE:

- Returns SUCCESS if key was added/updated 
- Returns FAILURE if key could not be added or updated


### Get
#### void * Get(HashMap * map, char * key, int * status_ptr)

Get will retrieve the data element for a specified key if that key exists in the given HashMap. If the key does not exist in the HashMap, NULL is returned.

Note - If a key has a NULL data value, that NULL will be returned by Get. The result of the status variable pointed at in the argument will state whether a value was successfully retrieved (SUCCESS) or if the key could not be found/error occurred. So if Get returns NULL and the status variable is SUCCESS, the key exists in the HashMap and is NULL. If Get returns NULL and status is FAILURE, then the key isn't in the HashMap.

ARGUMENTS:

- map: pointer to valid HashMap to search for key in
- key: string key to find value for
- status_ptr - pointer to variable where SUCCESS or FAILURE will be stored on return (if NULL, status won't be saved) 

RETURN VALUE:
- Returns data value if key-value exists in HashMap
- Returns NULL if key could not be located or data is NULL (check *status_ptr for clafication)

### Delete
#### void * Delete(HashMap * map, char * key, int * status_ptr)

Delete will remove the key-value pair from the HashMap for a given key if that key exists in the HashMap. If the key exists the key-value pair is removed, the data element for that key is returned.

Note - If a key has a NULL data value, that NULL will be returned by Delete. The result of the status variable  pointed at in the argument will state whether a value was successfully retrieved (SUCCESS) or if the key could not be found/error occurred. So if Delete returns NULL and the status variable is SUCCESS, the key existed in the HashMap and the data was NULL. If Delete returns NULL and status is FAILURE, then the key wasn't in the HashMap.

ARGUMENTS:

- map: pointer to valid HashMap to delete entry from
- key: string key to delete
- status_ptr - pointer to variable where SUCCESS or FAILURE will be stored on return (if NULL, status won't be saved)
  
RETURN VALUE:

- Returns data value if key-value existed in the HashMap and was deleted
- Returns NULL if key did not exist or data element was NULL (check *status_ptr for clafication)


### GetLoad
#### float GetLoad(HashMap * map)

GetLoad returns the load factor for the specified HashMap (defined as entries currently map divided by the size of the HashMap). Load factor is a float valuebetween 0 and 1.00. 

ARGUMENTS:

- map: pointer to valid HashMap to retrieve load from 

RETURN VALUE:

- Returns load factor if map exists
- Returns FAILURE if map or map value array does not exist


### DeleteMap
#### int DeleteMap(HashMap * map)

DeleteMap will free the space allocated for a HashMap (all keys, HashNode array and map structure itself). Argument map should be set to NULL after call to DeleteMap since it will point to invalid memory after all structures are freed.

ARGUMENTS:

- map - pointer to valid HashMap to delete

RETURN VALUE:

- Returns SUCCESS if memory was freed and map was cleared
- Returns FAILURE if map or values array was invalid


### PrintMap
#### void PrintMap(HashMap * map)

PrintMap prints the HashMap to stdout 

ARGUMENTS:

- map: pointer to valid HashMap to print

RETURN VALUE:

- NA
